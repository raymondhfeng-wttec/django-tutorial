        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p> Poker data grabber takes information trapped in GUIs, and displays them in a sleek webpage. The main parts of the project are as follows. </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Django Rest API Server. Upon API request, return a screenshot of the GUI. Uses base64 to encode.</li>
          <li>Django Server. Makes periodic calls to the Django Rest API, does processing, inserts the data into database. Displays data.</li>
          <li>Celery-Beat. Task automation. Redis for message brokering. </li>
          <li>OCR. After getting the screenshot, use PIL, CV2, Pytesseract to do OCR and inserts into backend database.</li>
          <li>Chartjs. Render the data into charts. </li>
          <li>Autoscreen. Automatically capture screenshots at preset time interval. </li>
          <li>Nginx to expose both the API and the main site to the outside world. </li>
        </ul>

        <xmp>
           ...code...
           fdsfdsfds
        </xmp>
        
        <h2>REST API</h2>

        <p>The REST API can be cloned from my github. There is not much special configuration needed, and the API simply traverses a directory for the most recent screenshot, and returns it in a JSON payload after encoding in base64. Configuring some directories and doing runserver will suffice. Then use nginx to expose the local server to the outside world. Autoscreen needs to be installed so that screenshots are taken periodically.</p>

        <h2>Main Django Server</h2>
        <p>After cloning from github, need to install Django Celery Beat (INSERT TUTORIAL SITE). The tasks are already created and you just need to start them with the celery command. Redis also needs to be installed (INSERT TUTORIAL SITE) and that server needs to be run. Also need to make the migrations locally. </p>
        <xmp>
          python manage.py makemigrations
          python manage.py migrate 
          python manage.py runserver
          redis-server 
          celery -A mysite_3 worker -l info -B
        </xmp>
        <p> Need to import the OCR code module, a bunch of requirements are necessary, as the celery task is dependent on that. Also need to install Chartjs (INSERT TUTORIAL SITE).</p>
